Analysis of 10x genomics scRNA-seq data using sincei
====================================================

The data used here is produced in our :doc:`10x genomics multiome tutorial <sincei_tutorial_10x>`.

We will use the BAM files, barcodes and peaks.bed file obtained from the **cellranger-arc**
workflow. Alternatively, the BAM file (tagged with cell barcodes) and peaks.bed can be obtained from
a custom mapping/peak calling workflow, and the list of filtered cell barcodes can be obtained using
sincei (see the :doc:`parent tutorial <sincei_tutorial_10x>` for explanation).

Define common bash variables:

.. code:: bash

   cd 10x_multiome_testdata
   # create dir
   mkdir sincei_output/rna

Additionally, we will need a blacklist file to filter out reads aligned to known problematic regions
of the human genome. This file and blacklists for other genome assemblies can be downloaded from the
`Boyle lab ENCODE blacklist repository <https://github.com/Boyle-Lab/Blacklist>`__.

.. code:: bash

   wget -O hg38-blacklist.v2.bed.gz https://github.com/Boyle-Lab/Blacklist/blob/master/lists/hg38-blacklist.v2.bed.gz

2. Quality control - I (read-level)
-----------------------------------

In order to identify high quality cells for our analysis, we can use the read-level quality
statistics from :ref:`scFilterStats`. Low quality cells in this data can be identified using several
criteria, such as:

- high number of PCR duplicates (filtered using `--duplicateFilter`)
- high fraction of reads aligned to blacklisted regions (filtered using `--blackListFileName`)
- high fraction of reads with poor mapping quality (filtered using `--minMappingQuality`)
- vey high/low GC content of the aligned reads, indicating the reads were mostly aligned to
  low-complexity regions (filtered using `--GCcontentFilter`)
- high level of secondary/supplementary alignments (filtered using `--samFlagExclude/Include`)

.. code:: bash

   for rep in rep1 rep2
   do
      bamfile=cellranger_output_${rep}_gex_possorted_bam.bam
      barcodes=sincei_output/rna/rna_barcodes_filtered_${rep}.txt # from sincei or cellranger output
      blacklist=hg38-blacklist.v2.bed

      scFilterStats -p 8 \
         --GCcontentFilter '0.2,0.8' \
         --minMappingQuality 10 \
         --samFlagExclude 256 \
         --samFlagExclude 2048 \
         --blackListFileName ${blacklist} \
         --barcodes ${barcodes} \
         --cellTag CB \
         --label rna_${rep} \
         -o sincei_output/rna/scFilterStats_output_${rep}.tsv \
         -b ${bamfile}
   done

:ref:`scFilterStats` summarizes these outputs as a table, which can then be visualized using the
`MultiQC tool <https://multiqc.info/docs/>`__, to select appropriate list of cells to include for
counting.

.. code:: bash

   multiqc sincei_output/rna/ # results in multiqc_report.html

3. Signal aggregation (counting reads)
--------------------------------------

Below we use sincei to aggregate signal from single-cells. For gene expression data, we aggregate
the signal from reads mapping to genes. For this we can use a GTF file containing gene annotations.

If needed, we can use the same parameters as in :ref:`scFilterStats` to count only high quality
reads from our whitelist of barcodes.

.. code:: bash

   ## Download the GTF file
   curl -o sincei_output/hg38.gtf.gz http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/bigZips/genes/hg38.refGene.gtf.gz
   gunzip sincei_output/hg38.gtf.gz

   # count reads on the GTF file
   for rep in rep1 rep2
   do
      bamfile=cellranger_output_${rep}_gex_possorted_bam.bam
      barcodes=sincei_output/rna/rna_barcodes_filtered_${rep}.txt # from sincei or cellranger output
      genes_gtf=hg38.gtf

      scCountReads features -p 8 \
         --BED ${genes_gtf} \
         --minMappingQuality 10 \
         --samFlagExclude 256 \
         --samFlagExclude 2048  \
         --blackListFileName ${blacklist} \
         --barcodes ${barcodes} \
         --cellTag CB \
         -o sincei_output/rna/scCounts_rna_genes_${rep} \
         --label rna_${rep} \
         -b ${bamfile}
   done
   # Number of bins found: 74538

4. Quality control - II (count-level)
-------------------------------------

After counting, it is recommended to perform QC on these counts, in order to filter regions and
cells that have low counts, or have low enrichment of counts. Even though we already performed
read-level QC before, the counts distribution on our specified regions (bins/genes/peaks) could be
different from the whole-genome stats.

We can run :ref:`scCountQC` on the count data to get various statistics at region and cell level.
Running this tool with the ``--describe`` flag lists the metrics that can be used to filter
cells/regions.

.. code:: bash

   # list the metrics we can use to filter cells/regions
   for rep in rep1 rep2
   do
      scCountQC -i sincei_output/rna/scCounts_rna_genes_${rep}.h5ad --describe
   done

The tool :ref:`scCountQC` can be used for count-level QC and filtering of count data. With the
``--outMetrics`` option, the tool outputs the count statistics at region and cell level (labelled as
``<prefix>.regions.tsv`` and ``<prefix>.cells.tsv``). Just like :ref:`scFilterStats`, these outputs
can then be visualized using the `MultiQC tool <https://multiqc.info/docs/>`__, to select
appropriate metrics to filter out the unwanted cells/regions.

.. code:: bash

   # export the single-cell level metrics
   for rep in rep1 rep2
   do
      scCountQC -i sincei_output/rna/scCounts_rna_genes_${rep}.h5ad \
      -om sincei_output/rna/countqc_rna_genes_${rep}
   done
   
   # visualize output using multiQC
   multiqc sincei_output/rna/ # see results in multiqc_report.html

In this example, we detect >74500 genes in >13.7K cells here.

Below, we perform some basic filtering using :ref:`scCountQC`. We exclude the cells with <500 and
>10000 detected peaks (``--filterRegionArgs``). We also exclude peaks detected in too few cells
(<100) or in >90% of cells (``--filterCellArgs``).

.. code:: bash

   for rep in rep1 rep2
   do
      scCountQC -i sincei_output/rna/scCounts_rna_genes_${rep}.h5ad \
         -o sincei_output/rna/scCounts_rna_genes_filtered_${rep}.h5ad \
         -om sincei_output/rna/scCounts_rna_genes_${rep} \
         --filterRegionArgs "n_cells_by_counts: 100, 1500" \
         --filterCellArgs "n_genes_by_counts: 500, 15000"
   done

   ## rep 1
   # Applying filters
   # Cells post-filtering: 1092
   # Features post-filtering: 32888
   ## rep 2
   # Applying filters
   # Cells post-filtering: 1038
   # Features post-filtering: 32793


5. Combine counts for the 2 replicates
--------------------------------------

While it is recommended to perform count QC separately for each replicate, the counts can now be
combined into one file for more convenient for downstream analysis. We provide a tool
:ref:`scCombineCounts`, which can concatenate counts for cells based on common features (in
``multi-sample`` mode). It can also be used to concatenate different modalities based on a common
set of cells (in ``multi-modal`` mode).

Concatenating the filtered cells for the 2 replicates results in a total of ~12K cells.

.. code:: bash

   scCombineCounts \
      -i sincei_output/rna/scCounts_rna_genes_filtered_rep1.h5ad \
      sincei_output/rna/scCounts_rna_genes_filtered_rep2.h5ad \
      -o sincei_output/rna/scCounts_rna_genes_filtered.merged.h5ad \
      --method multi-sample \
      --labels rep1 rep2
   # Combined cells: 2130
   # Combined features: 31976

5. Dimensionality reduction and clustering
------------------------------------------

Finally, we will apply glmPCA to this data, assuming the data follows a poisson distribution (which
is appropritate for scRNA-seq count data), we will reduce the dimensionality of the data to 20
principal components (the default), followed by a graph-based (Leiden) clustering of the output.

.. code:: bash

   scClusterCells -i sincei_output/rna/scCounts_rna_genes_filtered.merged.h5ad \
      -m glmPCA \
      -gf poisson \
      --clusterResolution 0.8 \
      -op sincei_output/rna/scClusterCells_UMAP.png \
      -o sincei_output/rna/scCounts_rna_genes_clustered.h5ad

   # Coherence Score:  Coherence Score:  -0.9893882070519782
   # also produces the tsv file "sincei_output/rna/scClusterCells_UMAP.tsv"

(optional) Confirmation of clustering using metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below, we load this data in R and compare it to the cell metadata provided with our files to verify
that our clustering separates celltypes in a biologically meaningful way.

We can color our UMAP output from :ref:`scClusterCells` with the cell-type
information from `Persad et.
al. (2023) <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-023-01716-9>`__, that we provide on
`figshare <https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/10x_multiome_test_data_package/29424470/4>`__

The figure above shows that we can easily replicate the expected cell-type results from the 
scRNA-seq data using **sincei**. However there are some interesting differences, especially, a
separation of the CLP cluster into 2 clusters, where one of these clusters is similar to the
annotated pDC.

This was done using basic pre-processing steps, therefore the results should only improve with 
better cell/region filtering and optimizing the analysis parameters.

6. Creating bigwigs and visualizing signal on IGV
-------------------------------------------------

For further exploration of data, it can be useful to create pseudo-bulk coverage files (bigwigs)
that aggregate the signal across cells in our each of our clusters. The tool :ref:`scBulkCoverage`
takes the clustering information `.tsv` file produced by :ref:`scClusterCells`, along with the
corresponding BAM files, and aggregates the signal to create these bigwigs.

The parameters here are same as other sincei tools that work on BAM files, except that we can output
normalized bulk signal (specified using `--normalizeUsing` option) . Below, we produce
CPM-normalized bigwigs at 100bp resolution.

.. code:: bash

   scBulkCoverage -p 8 \
      --cellTag CB \
      --normalizeUsing CPM \
      --binSize 100 \
      --minMappingQuality 10 \
      --samFlagExclude 2048 \
      -b cellranger_output_rep1_gex_possorted_bam.bam \
      cellranger_output_rep2_gex_possorted_bam.bam \
      --labels rep1_rna_rep1 rep2_rna_rep2 \
      -i sincei_output/rna/scClusterCells_UMAP.tsv \
      -o sincei_output/rna/sincei_cluster
   # creates 11 files with names "sincei_cluster_<X>.bw" where X is 0, 1... 10

We can now inspect these bigwigs on IGV. Looking at the region around one of the markers described
in the original manuscript, **TAL1**, we can see that the CLPs (lymphoid) and pDCs lack its
expression, while the myeloid cells and HSCs present enriched signal. The neighboring gene **STIL**,
which is involved in cell-cycle regulation is not expressed in the highly proliferative HSC/HMP/MEP
cell clusters. Overall this confirms that the signal coverage extracted from our clusters broadly
reflects the biology of the underlying cell types.
